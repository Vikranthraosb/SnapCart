# Project Overview

This project requires the concurrent operation of three servers to fully experience its functionality. The servers are dedicated to Delivery, Location, and RazorPay integration.

## Running the Servers

Follow these steps in separate terminals:

1. **Delivery Server:**
   ```bash
   npx nodemon (nodemon should be installed first)
   ( The Delivery server will be running on port 9000 (http://localhost:9000). )

2. **location Server:**
   ```bash
   node server.js

3. **razorPay Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
